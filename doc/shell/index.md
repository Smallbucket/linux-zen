### <a id="shell_what">Shell 简介</a>
A shell is a program that provides an interface between a user and an operating system (OS) kernel. An OS starts a shell for each user when the user logs in or opens a terminal or console window.

A kernel is a program that:

* Controls all computer operations.
* Coordinates all executing utilities
* Ensures that executing utilities do not interfere with each other or consume all system resources.
* Schedules and manages all system processes.

By interfacing with a kernel, a shell provides a way for a user to execute utilities and programs.
